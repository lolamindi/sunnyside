# Sunnyside Agency Landing Page 

![sunnyside favicon](assets/logos-icons/favicon-32x32.png)![sunnyside logo](assets/readme/logo-readme.svg)


This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor [Sunnyside Agency coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef), where I used HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive landing page as similar to the original design as possible. My mini-project also includes testing using Jest to ensure that the mobile menu content appears and disappears on-click as it should.
